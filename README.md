# AUTHENTIC Sans

A typeface intended for situations where Oriya Sangam MN seems too sophisticated and LiHei Pro too vulgar, or vice versa. AUTHENTIC Sans explores the semiotic and aesthetic idiosyncrasies of the anonymous Latin glyphs included with CJK system fonts; the typeface aims to subvert the Eurocentric standards of typographic quality and refinement. Distributed freely under the SIL Open Font License, AUTHENTIC Sans is a reflection of the studio praxis: expanding and redefining the visual and cultural boundaries of default systems.
